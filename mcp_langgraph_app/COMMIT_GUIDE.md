## 🎉 Major Update: FastMCP Migration

This release migrates the Symptom Tracker to use the official **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** via the `fastmcp` library.

### ✨ What's New

- **Official MCP Protocol**: Now uses standard MCP with stdio transport
- **Embedded Server**: No separate MCP server process needed
- **Simpler Deployment**: Reduced from 3 to 2 processes
- **Better Interoperability**: Works with any MCP-compatible client

### 🔧 Breaking Changes

- Removed custom HTTP MCP server (port 8001 no longer needed)
- Changed tool return format to JSON strings (MCP standard)
- Updated startup process (no need to run `run_mcp_server.py`)

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with FastMCP instructions
- New architecture diagrams in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Added CHANGELOG.md for version tracking

### 🚀 Quick Start

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd mcp_langgraph_app
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd mcp_langgraph_app
streamlit run streamlit_app/app_v2.py
```

That's it! FastMCP runs automatically when needed.

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- fastmcp
- mcp
- langgraph
- fastapi
- streamlit
- See `requirements.txt` for full list

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
